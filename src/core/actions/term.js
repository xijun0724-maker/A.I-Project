/**
 * Preset term loader — PNU Teacher Education Pathways, Term 2 AY 2025-2026.
 *
 * Loading is split the same way the backup importer is: `applyTermSyllabi` is
 * the testable part (no dialog, no navigation, returns counts), and
 * `loadTermSyllabi` is the thin UI wrapper that confirms first.
 *
 * Deadlines are the only dated thing it writes: lessons keep their week number
 * so the Roadmap derives each week's window from the configured term start.
