/**
 * PNU Teacher Education Pathways — Term 2 AY 2025-2026 session maps.
 *
 * Source documents (both on the CMIMO syllabus template, Rev. 01-06-2025,
 * DC No. CC01062025-1888):
 *   - TEDPaths_TGED04_Ethics.pdf ............................... TGED 04 Ethics
 *   - TPROFED05 Syllabus - Managing Learning Environment,
 *     Term 2 AY 2025-2026_DDM.pdf ..................... TPROFED05 Managing the
 *                                                       Learning Environment
 *
 * Both syllabi number *sessions*, not weeks, and some sessions span several
 * weeks. They are normalised here to one session per week:
 *
 *   - Ethics sessions 2-4 ("Living Ethically"), 7-8 ("Media Integrity") and
 *     9-10 ("Diversity, Pluralism and Ethics") are split into single weeks,
 *     which is what turns the source's 8 session blocks into 12 weeks.
 *   - TPROFED05 session 0 (course overview) is folded into week 1, and the
 *     content-management rows numbered 3-5 become weeks 3-5, so its sessions
 *     1-12 land on weeks 1-12 with session 6 (midterm / wellness break) on
 *     week 6.
 *
 * No dates are stored. `buildTermData(termStart)` anchors week 1 to the term
 * start configured in Settings, so the same session map serves any term: every
 * lesson carries a week number and lets the Roadmap and Planner derive its
 * dates, while assessment deadlines are materialised from that anchor because
 * tasks need concrete dates. Re-running the loader re-anchors them.
 *
 * Assessment weights are transcribed from each syllabus's grading system and
 * sum to 100% per course. Reading titles are taken from the course reference
 * lists; nothing here invents a source the syllabus does not name.
