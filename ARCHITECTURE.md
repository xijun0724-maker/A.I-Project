# Journey A.I — Architecture

Journey A.I is a single-page web app written in **vanilla JavaScript (ES modules)**. There is **no backend**: no FastAPI, no PostgreSQL, no React, no LangChain, no vector database. Persistence is `localStorage`; retrieval is BM25 in the browser; AI calls go directly from the page to Gemini or OpenRouter over `fetch()`.

> Note: `docs/architecture.md` is the short module-layer tour; this root document is the source of truth for the stack, the invariants and the refactor baseline.

## Stack

| Concern | Actual implementation |
| --- | --- |
| UI | Vanilla JS string-rendered views into `#viewRoot`; hash router (`src/core/router.js`) |
| State / persistence | `localStorage` key `journeyai.db.v1` (sync bootstrap) + IndexedDB mirror `journeyai/kv` (async, larger capacity), schemaVersion 4 (`src/core/store.js`, `src/core/idb.js`, `src/config/settings.js`) |
| API keys | `sessionStorage` only (`src/utils/secure.js`): per-provider record, last-used stamp, TTL; not encrypted (a browser cannot hide a secret from same-origin script), stripped before persist |
| RAG | Lexical BM25 index over chunked documents (`src/domain/rag.js`); optional hybrid BM25 + ONNX re-rank (`src/domain/rag-embeddings.js`, off by default via `settings.hybridRAG`) |
| AI providers | Gemini + OpenRouter via browser `fetch()` (`src/ai/client.js`) |
| Offline fallback | Rule-based extractive answers (`src/ai/offline.js`) |
| Styling | CSS custom properties in `src/styles/` (tokens, layout, components); every token read without a fallback must be declared there (`tests/vitest/styles.test.js`); width breakpoints limited to the canonical scale in `src/styles/index.css` (same test file) |
| Build / test | Vite 5 + Vitest 2 (`vite.config.js`); zero runtime npm dependencies |
| Lint / format | ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.js`); Prettier 3; Stylelint 17 (`lint:css`) |
| CI | GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/static.yml`): a `verify` job runs install, lint (`--max-warnings 0`), tests and build; the Pages `deploy` job declares `needs: verify` |

## Module layers

```
index.html (SPA shell, CSP meta, inline load-failure fallback)
  → src/main.js (entry: browser-support check, then boot)
    → src/app/ (bootstrap, chrome, focus-trap, lifecycle, actions-delegation, scroll-reveal)
      → src/core/ (router, state/scope, store, actions/)
      → src/views/ (screen renderers incl. calendar + modals/)
      → src/domain/ (tasks, nlp, rag, rag-embeddings, planner, academic-calendar, coach, dashboard, pipeline)
      → src/ai/ (client, prompts, offline, snapshot, agent, index)
      → src/utils/ (date, dom, helpers, format, feedback, markdown, secure, extract, cdn)
      → src/config/ (constants CFG, settings schema/migrations, templates, standards/)
      → localStorage (sync bootstrap) + sessionStorage (API keys)
      → IndexedDB (async mirror, restored when localStorage is missing/older)
```

## Data model (`Store.db`)

- `courses[]`, `lessons[]`, `events[]` (subtasks), `readings[]`
- `documents[]` (full text, max `CFG.maxDocChars`), `chunks[]` (BM25 ranges)
- `chat[]` (tutor history, sliced to `CFG.maxChatMessages`)
- `activity[]`, `plan[]`, `planMeta`, `settings`

## Design constraints (keep these invariants)

1. **Zero runtime dependencies** — business logic stays vanilla ESM; the only CDN UMD libs are pdf.js and mammoth for PDF/DOCX extraction (`src/utils/cdn.js`). There is no charting library.
2. **Offline-first** — NLP and RAG are deterministic; AI paths degrade to `offlineAnswer` / `offlineStudyPlan`.
3. **Keys never persist** — `stripKey()` before every `localStorage` / IndexedDB write; keys live only in `sessionStorage`.
4. **Action dispatch** — UI events use `data-act` attributes routed through `src/core/actions/` and `src/app/actions-delegation.js`.
5. **Sync load, async mirror** — `Store.load()` stays synchronous (localStorage); boot then `await Store.hydrateFromIDB()` so a newer IndexedDB snapshot wins before any view reads. When `indexedDB` is missing (tests / happy-dom) the app is localStorage-only.

## Baseline (re-verified 2026-09-25)

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run test` | **786 passed** (47 files) |
| `npm run build` | OK — `index.html` 11.73 kB (gzip 3.31), CSS 123.37 kB (gzip 21.55), JS code-split into **two** chunks: 307.41 kB entry + 13.56 kB lazy chunk (gzip 99.05 + 4.40); prints three dynamic-import warnings (the three views imported both statically via `views/index.js` and dynamically via `core/actions/index.js` never actually split) |
| `npm run lint` | **Passes clean** — 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `npm run format:check` | Not enforced in CI; run `npm run format` before committing |
| Coverage thresholds | statements 60 / branches 50 / functions 60 / lines 60 (`vite.config.js`) |

Every gate above is now enforced on push. `.github/workflows/static.yml` runs `npm ci`,
`npm run lint -- --max-warnings 0`, `npm test` and `npm run build` in a `verify` job, and the
Pages `deploy` job declares `needs: verify`. The install deliberately stays out of the deploy
job: that job uploads the working tree as-is (`path: '.'`), so installing dependencies there
would ship `node_modules` inside the Pages artifact.

The pre-refactor baseline (412 tests, lint failing with 33 errors) is recorded in
`docs/audit-2026-09-23.md`, which also tracks every fix since. The stale copy in
`docs/architecture.md` was rewritten rather than trusted.

### Why the build gate exists (2026-09-24)

Pages serves this repository as **raw source** — `index.html` loads `src/main.js` as an ES module —
so a dangling named import is fatal in the browser, not merely a build error. A rename
(`exportCSV` → `exportRoadmap`) orphaned one import in `src/core/actions/index.js`; native ESM
enforces that link, so `main.js` never executed and the site rendered nothing. Neither existing
guard could see it: Vitest resolves the missing binding to `undefined`, so the suite stayed green,
and `KNOWN_ACTIONS` derived action *names* from the dispatch table's keys without checking the
values were callable. Only Rollup caught it, and no workflow ran Rollup.

Fixed, and hardened around: the derived guard now asserts every dispatch handler is a function,
a test parses the `index.html` inline scripts (the load-failure fallback was itself a syntax
error, so the outage showed a permanent spinner instead of its own diagnostic), `export-csv` was
consolidated into `export-roadmap`, and the `verify` job above was added.

## Refactor roadmap (approved)

Status against the original roadmap (details and verification in `docs/audit-2026-09-23.md`):

0. This document + baseline — **done**; baseline re-verified (767 tests, lint clean, lint:css clean, build green).
1. Token budget, structured-output validation, citation checks (`src/ai/client.js`, `prompts.js`, `index.js`) — **done**.
2. Optional hybrid BM25 + ONNX semantic RAG (`rag-embeddings.js`, off by default) — **done**.
3. Answer confidence widget + Socratic tutor scaffolding — **done** (confidence widget; tutor modes pre-existing).
4. `StudyPlanAgent` tool loop (`src/ai/agent.js`) — **done**, and hardened: idempotent tool calls, wall-clock ceiling, aggregated usage, and a user-facing Stop control.
5. NLP standards registry (PNU / generic / custom) — **done** (`src/config/standards/`).
6. Planner interleaving and spacing — **done**; the AI plan is a proposal the student accepts, edits or rejects (`studyPlanProposal` + plan-preview flow), and import can no longer overwrite a plan silently.
7. Accessibility: contrast, focus, reduced motion — **done** for contrast (WCAG-AA token table in `tests/vitest/styles.test.js`) and focus handling; reduced motion ships in `styles/`.
8. AI contract tests (`tests/vitest/ai-contract.test.js`) — **done**.
9. Retrieval honesty — **done**: relevance floor, honest source labelling, numeric tokenisation, separate context budget, and pair-safe truncation with untrusted-content fencing.
10. Dead surface removed — the unused AI syllabus-parser prompts and validator were deleted (parsing is deterministic `NLP.analyse` on-device); Settings/README copy states what a key actually adds.

Known remaining limitations are tracked in the audit documents. Two supersede the 2026-09-23
entries: the heuristic confidence widget is gone (replaced by `answerProvenance` +
`renderProvenance`, which measure provenance and never claim to measure truth), and the agent's
wall-clock ceiling does not hold because `chatWithRetry` re-arms the caller's full timeout on each
retry. Still open: no token streaming, scaffolding that does not fade for experienced users, and
`style-src 'unsafe-inline'` (forced by inline `style` attributes in views). See
`docs/audit-2026-09-25.md` for the current prioritised list and status delta.
