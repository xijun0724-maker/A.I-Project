## Features

- **Syllabus Import** — Upload PDF, DOCX, or text syllabi. Journey parses deadlines, lessons, readings, and assessment weights automatically.
- **Task Management** — Track assignments, exams, projects, and quizzes with automatic effort estimation and priority scoring.
- **Study Planner** — Generates a weekly study schedule based on your available hours, deadlines, and priorities.
- **AI Study Tutor** — Ask questions about your courses, get summaries, and receive personalised study guidance (optionally connected to Google Gemini or OpenRouter free models).
- **Library & RAG** — Upload lecture notes, textbooks, and references. Built-in BM25 retrieval surfaces relevant passages for the AI tutor — no API key required.
- **Dashboard** — Visualise workload by week, track completion rates, view grades, and monitor study trends.
- **Calendar Export** — Export deadlines to Google Calendar, Outlook, or Apple Calendar as `.ics` files.
- **Accessible Design** — Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, reduced motion, and print-optimised styles.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xijun0724-maker/A.I-Project.git
   cd A.I-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

A demo dataset is seeded automatically on first visit.

## Usage

### Importing a Syllabus

1. Click **Import syllabus** in the sidebar or top bar.
2. Drag-and-drop or select a PDF, DOCX, TXT, or CSV file.
3. Review the extracted lessons, deadlines, and readings.
4. Confirm to add them to your courses.

### Using the AI Tutor

1. Navigate to **AI tutor** in the sidebar.
2. Optionally connect Google Gemini or OpenRouter in **Settings** — Journey works without a provider.
3. Ask questions about your uploaded documents and courses.

### Building a Study Plan

1. Go to **Planner** and set your available study hours.
2. Click **Generate plan** to create a weekly schedule.
3. Export to CSV or follow the plan directly in the app.

## Architecture

Journey A.I is a single-page web application with:

- **Zero runtime dependencies** — runs on vanilla JavaScript and browser APIs.
- **UMD libraries** loaded via CDN for PDF parsing (`pdf.js`) and DOCX extraction (`mammoth`).
- **localStorage** for all persistence — no backend required.
- **BM25 retrieval** for document search — runs entirely in the browser.
- **Two AI providers** — Google Gemini and OpenRouter free models, called directly from the browser with no SDK and no proxy.
- **Service Worker** caches CDN libraries and Google Fonts for faster repeat loads.

### Security

- API keys are stored in `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`) and are never written to disk.
- Keys are stripped before any data is persisted to `localStorage`.
- Documents never leave your browser unless you ask the AI tutor a question with a connected provider.

The entry point is `src/main.js`, loaded as an ES module in `index.html`.

Suite names map one-to-one to files in `tests/vitest/` — "Planner scheduling" is
`tests/vitest/planner.test.js`, and so on. The counts are a snapshot, not a gate: the
enforced numbers are the coverage thresholds in `vite.config.js`. Re-read them from
`npm test` whenever suites are added.

All tests run without a browser, API keys, or network access — they exercise pure functions and in-memory stores.

## AI Provider Setup

Journey A.I works without any AI provider — the syllabus analyser, deadline extraction, task decomposition, retrieval, and planner are all built in. Connecting a provider adds conversational explanations, tutoring modes, and a written study plan. Syllabi are always parsed on-device.

Keys are entered in the in-app **Settings** panel and live only in `sessionStorage`. A `.env`
file is never read — the app is client-only — so [`.env.example`](.env.example) is documentation
only, not a setup step.

**Supported providers:**

| Provider                 | Key Required | Default Model      |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Google Gemini            | Yes          | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| OpenRouter (free models) | Yes          | `openrouter/free`  |

Gemini keys come from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and OpenRouter keys
from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys). OpenRouter defaults to its free auto-router and
offers a fixed list of free models (DeepSeek, Gemma, Qwen, Nemotron) in the model dropdown.

Those two hosts are the only endpoints the app may reach: `index.html` sets a CSP `connect-src`
allowlisting exactly `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` and `openrouter.ai`. Adding a provider
means updating both `src/ai/client.js` and that policy.

## Service Worker

The service worker (`sw.js`) caches CDN libraries (pdf.js, mammoth) and Google Fonts using a cache-first strategy. This provides:

- Faster repeat page loads
- Offline access to cached assets
- Automatic cache invalidation when `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js` is bumped

The service worker is registered by the inline script in `index.html` when the page is served over HTTPS or localhost. It uses a **relative** path (`sw.js`) so its scope resolves correctly when the site is served from a GitHub Pages project subpath rather than a domain root.

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). For best results use a local server — `npm run dev` starts one with hot reload.
